# SpeakUp  
(android app tackling social issue)

### If user is inconvenienced by anything, (for eg. escalator at station not working, or too much open garbage dumped at a particular place) they can:  
* create a "Story" titled 'Escalator at Grant Road station'  
* add a description to the story  
* add a picture to the story  
* add a possible solution to the problem  

### Then add the story to their current location/nearby location in the built-in map of the app.   
(Using Firebase to store the stories and Google maps API to get location and for map-view)

### Other users can:  
* view Stories  
* upvote/second the problem or Story  

The data from this app can be used to increase awareness and by government authorities/the BMC to take necessary actions by giving priority to the most upvoted problems.

### Features to be added:  
* view 'nearby' stories based on location  
* suggest solutions to problems posted by other users
